how would you modify these scripts in order to compute the frequency of each of the quantities
(instead of the number of occurrences)?

Currently to calculate the number of occurences, we are adding each time the n-gram occurs. In order to change this to 
be calculating frequency instead, we would need to keep track of the time passed between each occurence. After doing this, 
we would add up all of the times between each occurence and divide it by the number of occurence to get the average frequency. 
To do this, we would have a variable to keep track of how much time has passed. Each time an occurence of that specific value 
occures, we would add that time to an array and reset the variable to 0. By the end of it, we would have all the times it took for 
each occurence, and then can use these values to find the average frequency.
